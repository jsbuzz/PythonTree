# Recursive generator examples

The example code is a very simple implementation of a binary search tree. The task is to make the data structure iterable without storing the parent for each node - saving ~25% of memory on each node.

Best way to do this is with recursive generators. You can find the same implementation in python3, php7 and javascript es6.
